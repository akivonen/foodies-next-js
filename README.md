# Foodies App

A simple Next.js 15 project focused on building a dynamic food exploration application using the App Router. This project was developed as part of the Udemy course "Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide".

## Main Features

- **File-based Routing and React Server Components**: Implemented routing using the Next.js file system, understanding the difference between server and client components.
  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilized dynamic routes and route parameters to handle meal details pages dynamically.

- **Layouts and Pages**: Managed application structure with layouts, including both global and nested layouts for different sections of the site.

- **Custom Components**: Integrated custom components across the app, both within layouts and pages, to promote reusability.

- **Styling**: Employed CSS Modules for component-specific styling, ensuring clean and maintainable CSS.

- **Image Optimization**: Used Next.js's Image component to optimize image loading and performance.

- **Data Fetching and Database Interaction**: Set up SQLite for local data storage, fetched data using Next.js capabilities for full-stack development, and managed data operations on the server.

- **Loading and Error States**: Enhanced user experience by implementing loading states with Suspense and managing errors and 'not found' states effectively.

- **Form Handling**: Developed a form for sharing meals using server actions for handling submissions, including image uploads, input validation, and protection against XSS attacks.

- **Server Actions**: Managed form submissions on the server side, ensuring better performance and security, with actions stored in separate files for better organization.

- **Caching and Revalidation**: Learned about Next.js caching mechanisms, how to trigger cache revalidations, and considerations for storing files in production environments.

- **SEO**: Added both static and dynamic metadata to improve search engine visibility.
